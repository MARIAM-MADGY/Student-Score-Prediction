# 📘 Student Score Prediction  

A simple machine learning project that uses **Linear Regression** to estimate students' exam performance from their study hours.  

## 🔍 What I Did  
- Collected and explored the **Student Performance Factors** dataset.  
- Cleaned the data and performed **EDA** to identify patterns.  
- Built and trained a **Linear Regression model**.  
- Compared predicted scores with actual ones through visualization.  
- Assessed model accuracy using **R²** and **MSE** metrics.  

## 🚀 Next Steps  
- Apply **Polynomial Regression** to capture non-linear patterns.  
- Include additional features (e.g., sleep hours, participation) for better accuracy.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Python**: core language  
- **Pandas & NumPy**: data handling  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: visualization  
- **Scikit-learn**: model building and evaluation
